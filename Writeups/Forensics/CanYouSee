How about some hide and seek? Download this file here. 

Solution: 

First thing that i checked was the file type, using the file command

┌──(horia㉿horia)-[~/Documents/forensics]
└─$ file ukn_reality.jpg
ukn_reality.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 72x72, segment length 16, baseline, precision 8, 4308x2875, components 3
                                                                                                                                                              
As you can see it really is a jpg so i used the online tool https://www.aperisolve.com/ to dig deeper
Once i uploaded the image i checked the strings

JFIF

Upon a closer look i noticed 'cGljb0NURntNRTc0RDQ3QV9ISUREM05fZDhjMzgxZmR9Cg==' which looks like a base64 string.
I decoded it with https://www.base64decode.org/ and got the flag
